Due to the computational complexity of the original model, consisting of 196 compartments, a reduced morphology model was used, where passive parameters, ion channel conductances and parameters describing Ca2+ dynamics were properly fitted. The inhibitory cells in the network were based on a model of fast-spiking PV+ basket cells. These two single cell models were combined into a microcircuit network model consisting of 256 excitatory and 64 inhibitory neurons. Cells were connected via AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in the case of excitatory connections and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents for inhibitory connections. Additionally, model cells received two types of input, Poissonian noise to all cells representing background activity in the cortex and rhythmic input representing the sensory input during auditory entrainment. A smaller percentage of inhibitory interneurons (35%) received no sensory input drive.</p>",,9

We simulated A1 as a cortical column with a depth of 2000 μm and 200 μm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Neuron densities, laminar locations, classes, morphology and biophysics, and connectivity at the long-range, local and dendritic scale were derived from published experimental data. The A1 model included 6 cortical layers and multiple populations of neurons consisting of 4 excitatory and 4 inhibitory types, and was reciprocally connected to the thalamus (MGB and TRN) mimicking anatomical connectivity. MGB included core and matrix thalamocortical neurons with layer-specific projection patterns to A1, and thalamic interneurons projecting locally. Auditory stimulus related inputs were simulated using phenomenological models of the cochlear auditory nerve and the inferior colliculus, which served as input to MGB. The model generated cell type and layer-specific firing rates consistent with overall ranges observed experimentally, and accurately simulated the corresponding local field potentials (LFPs), current source density (CSD), and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Laminar CSD patterns during spontaneous activity and responses to speech input were similar to those recorded experimentally. Physiological oscillations emerged spontaneously across frequency bands without external rhythmic inputs and were comparable to those recorded in vivo. We used the model to unravel the contributions from distinct cell type and layer-specific neuronal populations to oscillation events detected in CSD, and explore how these relate to the population firing patterns. Overall, the computational model provides a quantitative theoretical framework to integrate and interpret a wide range of experimental data in auditory circuits. It also constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate hypotheses and make predictions about the cellular and network mechanisms underlying common experimental measurements, including MUA, LFP and EEG signals.</p>",,2

Its neural origin remains unclear. Experimental findings are often puzzling and sometimes contradictory. Most computational models rely on pairs of pacemaker neurons or neural populations tuned at different frequencies to produce PAC. Here, using a data-driven model of a hippocampal microcircuit, we demonstrate that PAC can naturally emerge from a single feedback mechanism involving an inhibitory and excitatory neuron population, which interplay to generate theta frequency periodic bursts of higher frequency gamma. The model suggests the conditions under which a CA1 microcircuit can operate to elicit theta-gamma PAC, and highlights the modulatory role of OLM and PVBC cells, recurrent connectivity, and short term synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, the results suggest the experimentally testable prediction that the generation of the slow population oscillation requires the fast one and cannot occur without it.</p>",,15

However, most approaches to date consist ofdeterministic associations between the recognised activities and the robot behaviours, neglecting the uncertainty inherent tosequential predictions in real-time applications. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting an initial neuroroboticsmodel that embeds, in a simulated robot, computational models of parts of the mammalian brain that resembles neurophysiological aspects of the basal ganglia–thalamus–cortex (BG–T–C) circuit, coupled with human activity recognitiontechniques. A robotics simulation environment was developed for assessing the model, where a mobile robot accomplishedtasks by using behaviour selection in accordance with the activity being performed by the inhabitant of an intelligent home.Initial results revealed that the initial neurorobotics model is advantageous, especially considering the coupling betweenthe most accurate activity recognition approaches and the computational models of more complex animals.</p>",,19

That processing profoundly influences whether stimuli are correctly or incorrectly perceived as painful. Significant advances have been made in identifying the types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that comprise the SDH, and there is some information about how neuron types are connected, but it remains unclear how the overall circuit processes sensory input or how that processing is disrupted under chronic pain conditions. To explore SDH function, we developed a computational model of the circuit that is tightly constrained by experimental data. Our model comprises conductance-based neuron models that reproduce the characteristic firing patterns of spinal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, defined by their expression of genetic markers, spiking pattern, or morphology, were synaptically connected according to available qualitative data. Using a genetic algorithm, synaptic weights were tuned to reproduce projection neuron firing rates (model output) based on primary afferent firing rates (model input) across a range of mechanical stimulus intensities. Disparate synaptic weight combinations could produce equivalent circuit function, revealing degeneracy that may underlie heterogeneous responses of different circuits to perturbations or pathologic insults. To validate our model, we verified that it responded to the reduction of inhibition (i.e., disinhibition) and ablation of specific neuron types in a manner consistent with experiments. Thus validated, our model offers a valuable resource for interpreting experimental results and testing hypotheses <em id="""">in silico</em> to plan experiments for examining normal and pathologic SDH circuit function.</p>",,17

In 2015, the Blue Brain Project (BBP) developed a groundbreaking rat S1 microcircuit simulation with over 31,000 neurons with 207 morpho-electrical neuron types, and 37 million synapses, incorporating anatomical and physiological information from a wide range of experimental studies. We have implemented this highly detailed and complex S1 model in NetPyNE, using the data available in the Neocortical Microcircuit Collaboration Portal. NetPyNE provides a Python high-level interface to NEURON and allows defining complicated multiscale models using an intuitive declarative standardized language. It also facilitates running parallel simulations, automates the optimization and exploration of parameters using supercomputers, and provides a wide range of built-in analysis functions. This will make the S1 model more accessible and simpler to scale, modify and extend in order to explore research questions or interconnect to other existing models. Despite some implementation differences, the NetPyNE model preserved the original cell morphologies, electrophysiological responses and spatial distribution for all 207 cell types; and the connectivity properties of all 1941 pathways, including synaptic dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP). The NetPyNE S1 simulations produced reasonable physiological firing rates and activity patterns across all populations. When STP was included, the network generated a 1 Hz oscillation comparable to the original model in vitro-like state. By then reducing the extracellular calcium concentration, the model reproduced the original S1 in vivo-like states with asynchronous activity. These results validate the original study using a new modeling tool. Simulated local field potentials (LFPs) exhibited realistic oscillatory patterns and features, including distance- and frequency-dependent attenuation. The model was extended by adding thalamic circuits, including 6 distinct thalamic populations with intrathalamic, thalamocortical (TC) and corticothalamic connectivity derived from experimental data. The thalamic model reproduced single known cell and circuit-level dynamics, including burst and tonic firing modes and oscillatory patterns, providing a more realistic input to cortex and enabling study of TC interactions. Overall, our work provides a widely accessible, datadriven and biophysically-detailed model of the somatosensory TC circuits that can be employed as a community tool for researchers to study neural dynamics, function and disease.</p>",,3

We also implemented a method for scaling the network size that preserves firing rates and other statistics. Our new implementation enabled the use of more detailed neuron models with multicompartmental morphologies and multiple biophysically realistic ion channels. This opens the model to new research, including the study of dendritic processing, the influence of individual channel parameters, the relation to local field potentials (LFPs), and other multiscale interactions.

Most of these models have not been tested in dynamic visual environments where models must make predictions on future states and adjust their behavior accordingly. The models using these learning rules are often treated as black boxes, with little analysis on circuit architectures and learning mechanisms supporting optimal performance. Here we developed visual/motor spiking neuronal network models and trained them to play a virtual racket-ball game using several reinforcement learning algorithms inspired by the dopaminergic reward system. We systematically investigated how different architectures and circuit-motifs (feed-forward, recurrent, feedback) contributed to learning and performance. We also developed a new biologically-inspired learning rule that significantly enhanced performance, while reducing training time. Our models included visual areas encoding game inputs and relaying the information to motor areas, which used this information to learn to move the racket to hit the ball. Neurons in the early visual area relayed information encoding object location and motion direction across the network. Neuronal association areas encoded spatial relationships between objects in the visual scene. Motor populations received inputs from visual and association areas representing the dorsal pathway. Two populations of motor neurons generated commands to move the racket up or down. Model-generated actions updated the environment and triggered reward or punishment signals that adjusted synaptic weights so that the models could learn which actions led to reward. Here we demonstrate that our biologically-plausible learning rules were effective in training spiking neuronal network models to solve problems in dynamic environments. We used our models to dissect the circuit architectures and learning rules most effective for learning. Our model shows that learning mechanisms involving different neural circuits produce similar performance in sensory-motor tasks. In biological networks, all learning mechanisms may complement one another, accelerating the learning capabilities of animals. Furthermore, this also highlights the resilience and redundancy in biological systems.</p>",,12

In contrast, the performance of spiking neuronal network (SNN) models trained to perform similar behaviors remains relatively suboptimal. In this work, we aimed to push the field of SNNs forward by exploring the potential of different learning mechanisms to achieve optimal performance. We trained SNNs to solve the CartPole reinforcement learning (RL) control problem using two learning mechanisms operating at different timescales: (1) spike-timing-dependent reinforcement learning (STDP-RL) and (2) evolutionary strategy (EVOL). Though the role of STDP RL in biological systems is well established, several other mechanisms, though not fully understood, work in concert during learning <em id="""">in vivo</em>. Recreating accurate models that capture the interaction of STDP-RL with these diverse learning mechanisms is extremely difficult. EVOL is an alternative method and has been successfully used in many studies to fit model neural responsiveness to electrophysiological recordings and, in some cases, for classification problems. One advantage of EVOL is that it may not need to capture all interacting components of synaptic plasticity and thus provides a better alternative to STDP-RL. Here, we compared the performance of each algorithm after training, which revealed EVOL as a powerful method for training SNNs to perform sensory-motor behaviors. Our modeling opens up new capabilities for SNNs in RL and could serve as a testbed for neurobiologists aiming to understand multi-timescale learning mechanisms and dynamics in neuronal circuits.</p>",,13
